# In-Hospital Mortality

## Possible predictors
- Diseases Severity (PLOS Analysis of Adult characteristics and mortality ARTICLE)

- Testing a theory I have, that one can predict Mortality just by the number of interactions betweeen patient and hospital per day, I've used the following features for the Mortality prediction as a Classification problem:
Age, Gender, Admission Type, Admission Source
Daily average number of: Labs, Micro labs, IV meds, Non-IV meds, Imaging Reports, Notes, Orders, Caregivers, Careunits, etc
The label is Hospital Mortality. (Kaggle website)

- Lactate indices (PLOS 3 article)

- Other PLOS article

**Intuitively, It could be used a clustering algorithm to investigate on data regarding patients died in hospital to find common points.**

In general all articles could be good
